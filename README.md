# checking-the-geometric-property

This program consists in checking some geometric
properties, in this case: DO TWO QUADRANGLES INTERSECT?




## Goal

The program must receive from the user
the data required for specifying geometric objects, check them on
correctness and return the answer to the question.
## Geometric objects that are used

- A point, given by 2 real coordinates
- A segment, given by a start point and an end point.
- A quadrangle, defined by 4 consecutive vertices.
